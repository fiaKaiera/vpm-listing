### [Add to VCC](https://fiakaiera.github.io/vpm-listing)

- [Real-ish Doors](https://github.com/fiaKaiera/vpm-listing/tree/main/Packages/net.fiakaiera.door) v1.0.0
<br>VRChat door system that acts semi-realisitically.
<br>These doors can be locked or forced open/closed using events.

## Technical Details
The actual code for each package is found in the [Packages](https://github.com/fiaKaiera/vpm-listing/tree/main/Packages) folder.
<br>This is due to the project being set up to contain all of the packages as one Unity project.

Since each package is set up as one project, [source.json](https://github.com/fiaKaiera/vpm-listing/blob/main/source.json) will have to be manually updated for each new release.
