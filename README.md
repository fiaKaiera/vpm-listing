# fiaKaiera's VPM Catalogue
A collection of VRChat assets made by fiaKaiera collected into one repository.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend using the [ALCOM](https://vrc-get.anatawa12.com/en/alcom/) so you can add these packages in your VRChat project without much hassle.
> <br>[VRChat Creator Companion](https://vrchat.com/home/download) will still work fine.
> 
> Alternatively, `*.unitypackages` are provided should you not use them.
> <br>`*.zip` files are also provided but will have to be placed in its own folder in your Unity project's `Package` folder.

It's entirely optional but if you do, it will help spread the word and supports the growth of this asset within the VRChat community.

## Technical Details
The actual code for each package is found in the [Packages](Packages) folder.
<br>This is due to the project being set up to contain all of the packages as one Unity project.

Since each package is set up as one project, [source.json](https://github.com/fiaKaiera/vpm-listing/blob/main/source.json) will have to be manually updated for each new release.
